This repository consists of files and code used during the EDA part of the Animal Ecology Lab,
lead by Marta Witkowska PhD.

This Lab is a part of the course for students of 3rd year Biology and 2nd year of Protection of Natural Resources (aka OZP)

During the lab, students conduct two field experiments aimed at studying:
1) Biodiversity changes in the gradient of urbanization
2) Behavior of mallards in the flock, associated with competition for supplementary feeding resources

List of files:
2 spreadsheets containing data gathered by students:
- DiversityDB1.xlsx and DiversityDB2.xlsx - data from 2025 
- Hier_MainDB.xlsx

2 R scripts:
- diversity_census.R
- hier.script.R

R Markdown file, for easier interpretation of results for students (unfortunately they are not taught R at this stage)
- hier_markdown_script.Rmd
